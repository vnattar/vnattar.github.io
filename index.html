Through Project Eclipse, we bring hyperlocal air quality sensing to cities across the US, create awareness of local air quality and help understand its impact on the local communities. As a part of the interdisciplinary team, I helped design, calibrate and deploy the air quality sensors.

          <h6 class="w3-large w3-text-grey"><b>Battery-Free Sensing</b></h6>
          <p class="w3-large">As a summer intern in the Medical Devices Group at MSR in 2016 I developed a fully-analog wearable passive sensor for continuous physiological monitoring. I returned to work with the group in late 2017 to work on further integration of the system to an existing sensor framework and to validate it with testing. The vision for this work is to develop a bandaid-like device that can be worn on the body for bed-side monitoring of heart rate, breathing rate, temperature and audio. The device was also designed for sensor input flexibility as a plug-and-play platform that interfaces with different types of sensors. The prototype device performs sensing and communicates sensed signals at 35 to 160 micro Watts power budget (harvested from a 915MHz radio frequency continuous wave singal). Here is a link to the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3214282">"RF Bandaid: A Fully-Analog and Passive Wireless Interface for Wearable Sensors"</a>. this work received the distinguished paper award at Ubicomp 2019.</p>

            <li>Together with Jingxian Wang in 2020, I explored temperature sensing applications using battery-less tags and developed <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3517242">"ultralow-latency localization using the RFbandaid platform"</a>. This work demonstrates sub-centimetter location tracking at sub-millisecond latency.

          <p class="w3-large">I graduated with a Ph.D. from the <a href="https://sensor.cs.washington.edu">Sensor Systems Lab</a> at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA. My research interests involve developing low-power and wireless sensing systems for healthcare, environment and IoT applications. Specifically, I have worked on HF near-field and UHF far-field wireless energy harvesting, ultra-low-power wireless communication and computation for implantable and wearable devices.

             <p>My PhD research focussed on a closed loop neural interface for rehabilitation and reanimation of paralyzed limbs in patients with spinal cord injury. The images above are a summary of the <b>Brain-Computer-Sinal Interface (BCSI) system</b> development. They provide a system level block diagram and functional illustration along with the devices that I developed towards this. The system is designed to stimulate in the spinal cord based on intentions decoded from neural signals recorded in the brain and close the break in communication created by a spinal cord injury. </p>
              As a part of my PhD research, I worked on integrating the typical benchtop equiment that are used for neural interface into small circuit boards that are implantable. The key features of this system include <b><i>wireless power transfer, ultralow-power communication and closed-loop neural recording and stimulation</b></i>. The final prototype, the NeuralCLIP, demonstrates stimulation triggered by on-device decoding of action intent from Local Field Potentials (LFP) recorded in the motor cortex. To accommodate for variation in power availabile from a wireless power transfer link, the system implements processes as approximate computation blocks on a FPGA. I was awarded a graduate innovation fellowship from the <a href="http://uwin.washington.edu/students/graduate-students/current-graduate-fellows/"> Washington Research Foundation to support this work on the implantable neural interface device.</a> 

             <p>Apart form this I have worked on other cool projects including energy harvesting from RF and NFC for wearable sensors, analog backscatter, wireless power transfer using phased array systems and low-overhead echolocation for localizing receivers in a HF phased array power transfer system (links to publications in <a href= "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=up5DfNkAAAAJ&hl=en"> <b>My Google Scholar</b></a> page). I have also developed an FPGA implementation of the RFID EPC Gen2 protocol for performing block read and write with an Impinj R1000 RFID reader. This design was implemented for a 65nm CMOS IC development. Email me for the access to the FPGA library git repository.</p>
